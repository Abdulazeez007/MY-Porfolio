A dedicated and results-driven SOC Analyst with extensive hands-on experience in enhancing cybersecurity defenses and mitigating threats, refined through my internship at Log(N) Pacific and the Virtually Testing Foundation, California. I achieved a 20% improvement in threat detection efficiency through meticulous Security Control Validation and optimized incident response processes using automation, resulting in a 15% reduction in resolution times. My core competencies include Security Assessments, Log Analysis, Monitoring and Triaging, as well as developing customized playbooks to ensure efficient threat detection and response. I am committed to delivering measurable results in a fast-paced security operations environment.

## Objective

As a proactive SOC Analyst with a passion for cybersecurity, I aim to leverage my experience in threat detection, incident response, and security automation to contribute to innovative and secure solutions. My GitHub showcases projects focused on enhancing security operations, automating threat response, and improving system resilience. I'm committed to continuous learning and sharing knowledge with the cybersecurity community.
